0. Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis is an English name of lung disease. This is the longest word in English dictionary.

1. Getrusage returns resource usage measures for calling process, all children of calling process that have terminated and been waited for, or calling thread, in structure pointed to by usage.

2. There are 16 members in a variable of type struct rusage.

3. We pass before and after by reference, instead of value, for increased speed. Copying such a large structures is quite costly.

4. Main reads the file character by character. If the character is alphabetic, letters are added to the 'word' array. Numeric characters are skipped. If there is a minimum of one letter in the word and the iterator encounters any other character, that means the word is over. Finally, the word is spellchecked.

5. The scanf function's input needs to be 100% accurate, so if something is not formatted correctly, the scanf won't work properly. It is better to use fgetc to first read the file character by character and then parse its content.

6. The parameters for check and load are constants because we should not change their values.

7. I used a trie structure with 27 child nodes, one for each lowercase letter and one for the apostrophes.

8. My code was over three times slower than the staff solution.

9. I started by trying to use a hash table, but after repeated failures and learning more about the trie structure, decided to implement a trie instead.

10. At this point, I believe my code is as good as it is going to get. From my research, it seems I have implemented the best trie solution to handle the problem.
